# HANDWRITTEN CHARACTER RECOGNITION:

## DESCRIPTION

Brief description of your project goes here.

The Handwritten Character Recognition project is an innovative application of machine learning and deep learning techniques aimed at developing a robust Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow and Keras. The primary objective of this project is to accurately recognize English alphabets from A-Z in handwritten form. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset containing a large number of images of handwritten English alphabets, the project aims to create a powerful model capable of accurately detecting and recognizing characters from input images.


## PREREQUISITES

- [Python (latest version)] (https://www.python.org/)
- [Jupyter Notebook (for development and experimentation)] (https://jupyter.org/)

## INSTALLATION

To install the required Python libraries, navigate to the "Notebook" folder and run the following command:


pip install -r requirements.txt

Python (latest version), Jupyter Notebook (for development and experimentation)

## DATA SET:
The project utilizes the A-Z Handwritten Alphabets dataset provided by Sachin Patel. This dataset, available in CSV format, contains 372,450 images of alphabets, each with a size of 28x28 pixels. The dataset serves as the primary source of training data for the CNN model.
